### Unit One

> 主语+动词+宾语

```
The team notifies vendors of vulnerabilities
They inform Google of the release schedule
```

> 主语+动词+间接宾语（人或动物）+直接宾语   可以理解为给某人~、使某人做某事、让某人

```
The company give hime a reward √
They offered him a position √
The team notifies vendors vulnerabilities ×
They inform Google the release schedule ×
```

> 关系代名词 that 和 which 用它们两个来连接句子，具有连词和代名词的作用，那什么时候用that什么时候用which？

```
当代名词是主语时：that/which都可用
The team disclosed bugs that/which were present in Windows8.1
等价于
The team disclosed bugs.they were present in Windows8.1
先行词bugs指物，做主语，用主格关系代名词that/which
```

```
当代名词时宾语：that/which都可用
The hackers are looking into the products that/which Google makes
等价于
The hackers are looking into the products.Google makes them
先行词products指物，做宾语，用宾格关系代码词that/which
```

```
非限定性定语从句（用作补充说明前文内容,在句子不充当成分，缺少也不会影响全局的理解）：which可用
These flaws are called zero-day vulnerabilities,which are a common target of cyber criminals
等价于
These flaws are called zero-day vulnerabilities，and they are a commom target of cyber criminals
引导非限定性定语从句用关系代名词which 不能用that
```
